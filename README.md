# Obsidian Canvas Minimap Plugin

Canvas in Obsidian is a nice tool for capture and visualize ideas. However, with the growth of the canvas notes, it becomes hard to navigate and easy to get lost.

This plugin provides a minimap for canvas notes, which can help you to navigate and get an overview of the canvas.

## Usage
- Enable the minimap via the command palette or the settings.
- Profit!

## Note
Obsidian does not provide a public API for plugins to access the canvas notes. This plugin uses a workaround to access the canvas notes, which may not be stable and may break in the future.
